# Pi Shield

The PiShield is used to to interface the TSI board with the Raspberry Pi which runs SCADA. 
This board contains the DC/DC converter that allows to power the   Raspberry as well the different input pins 
to place the IMU and the RTC timer. It was inspired from the Logic board circuit created by the 2021 team. 
It was designed to separate the CAN circuit and the I2C Circuit
