TO DO:
- NEED TO DECIDE ON THE METHOD FOR GENERATING Throttle_Logic *
- NEED TO ADD ANOTHER JUMPER FOR THE NEW SELECT SIGNAL IN Throttle_Plausibility - if we end up keeping both 
- NEED TO CHECK IMD_FAULT and AMS_FAULT
- CHECK 3.3V Signal 
- ADD CAN OPTOISOLATOR
- CHANGE ALL OPTOISOLATOR
- CHECK U35A V+ signal (should be 5V not 3.3V on PCB)
- EDIT silkscreen for D16 and D17 labels (switch them) *
- Edit silkscreen for D10 (BOT & SCADA OK) *
- CHECK optoisolator for SR_CTRL & SR_CTRL_Boosted
- CHANGE ALL MCP6004 into TLV2464CDR *
- CHECK ALL NEW RESISTORS, CAPS & INDUCTOR(done) *
- CHECK I2C pull-up resistors *
