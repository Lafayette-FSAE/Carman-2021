* Check U43 
* Remove R97? C6?
* JP1 moved
* U18C
* BRAKE PRESSED (Brake_Light doesn't work if safety loop is not on) --> against the rule anyway
* PIC32
* U36 3.3V signal, 500mA current, sufficient for the PIC32?
* Consider moving MRESET_Contact from pin 4 to pin 3 of K2 + Add a jumper to give the option to always short SR_CTRL_Boosted to GLV_RTN
* U24 Optoisolator resistor calculations
* Is R61 a 1/2W resistor?
* U4??

TO DO:
*Change Sheet Names to match + be actual names not just text boxes
-- Change R50, R51 to 4.7K
-- Add ref voltage to U18C 
-- Use the same ref voltage everywhere (U7A-D, U18C)
(ADD TO ERRATA) For APPS1_b and APPS2_b, either use a precise 5V (already there) AND a precise 10V OR use the 10V to generate the 5V so they're both as imprecise. Maybe use a 24-10V DC-to-DC converter. Maybe just write a note
-- Dotted boxes --> specify the exact signal/device they represent 
-- Resistor R48 unnecessary
-- Change 5V -> 3.3V on Drive_LED circuit
(ADD TO ERRATA) U20 --> change the stupid design into a voltage divider that generates a reasonable voltage to be used with an inverter
(ADD TO ERRATA) Consider moving MRESET_Contact from pin 4 to pin 3 of K2 + Add a jumper to give the option to connect it to either 3 or 4 to switch it between NC or NO relays
-- Change pullup resistors for I2C
-- Make sure that all digital inputs are 3.3V
-- Include silkscreen for the jumpers
(ADD TO ERRATA) IMD_MHS isn't used anywhere, but it could be (PWM representation of isolation)
-- Add TP for voltages, ADD TP header that collects all TPs
